	<p><b>Rescued Date:</b> September 18, 2020<br>
	<b>Given Name:</b> Phoebe<br>
	<b>Sex:</b> Female<br>
	<b>Age:</b> Approximately 5 months<br>
	<br>
	We had to rescue this dog yesterday at the mainroad because people were pimping him. <br>
	Others often think they have rabies or a serious illness.
	It will be noticed that <br> he has bleeding wounds. 
	He was also found eating garbage because someone put food <br> there. The worse is that he is almost run over because he is disoriented. 
	The pedicab <br> driver said they were dropped off (2 dogs) from the vehicle, about 3 days ago. 
	But <br> there is no dog in the area.
	<br><br>
	Phoebe is now okay and totally recovered. He was also Spayed.

	<p><b>Rescued Date:</b> November 30, 2020<br>
	<b>Given Name:</b> Tuna<br>
	<b>Sex:</b> Female<br>
	<b>Age:</b> 1 years old<br>
	<br>
	These pictures were posted in a group, no one claimed but many wanted to take.
	The <br>rescuer does not want to give it to others because it will definitely breed.
	He was <br> found opposite the Tupas Funerary near the cemetery. It was raining hard 
	when he got <br> it. The driver in the front vehicle was pimping him so the rescuer 
	saw him. He was <br> infested with a tick and looked severely in pain.
	<br><br>
	Tuna is now okay and totally recovered.

	<p><b>Rescued Date:</b> August 18, 2018<br>
	<b>Given Name:</b>Filemon (Fil)<br>
	<b>Age:</b>2 years old<br>
	<b>Sex:</b> Female
	<br><br>
	Fil found abandoned. Emaciated and lethargic. Lots of itching up to her genitals. <br>
	Infested with fleas. The abdomen is also bloated, most probably due to internal <br> parasites.
 	Such diseases are curable. But other people just chose to throw the animal <br>away. 
	He was too small to find shelter and food.
	<br><br>
	<b>Fil is up for adoption!</b> Spayed and Dewormed.

	<p><b>Rescued Date:</b> 2015 <br>
	<b>Given Name:</b>Kevin <br>
	<b>Age:</b>7 years old<br>
	<b>Sex:</b> Male
	<br><br>
	He has been with us for 5 years. In 2015 we decided to keep him indoor because someone <br> shot their family. They were all taken to the vet but his mother and brother died. <br>
    We also looked for someone who could adopt him because Rigor always fights with him, <br> unfortunately rarely or no one wants to adopt when native breed. Kevin recovered from <br> his fatal wound and remained with other rescues at our house. <br><br>
    Kevin is living with us!
