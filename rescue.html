	Year 2012 my Uncle (Mama's brother) found him on the street during the heavy rain.<br> 
	Boots was not noticed immediately because the flood was high then and it was dark<br> 
    because it was early in the morning. 
	Boots is said to be looking for a possible climb.<br>
	Case he could not get on the parked pedicab. 
	He was picked up and taken to our house.
	<br><br>
	Boots was Spayed and now an indoor cat living with us.

	<br><br>
	A cat needs to be rescued at Manila Memorial Park today. The nose seems to be <br> rotting.Difficulty breathing and severely emaciated. The cat has a nasal tumor. <br>
    He was thin and hard to breathe. His diet was also affected by the bait. He seems <br>
    to have been seen in the cemetery for a long time. He only has food when people visit <br> there.
	<br><br>
	Mara was put to sleep because her nasal tumor was progressive. She also did not eat <br> and had difficulty breathing. You will always be in our hearts Mara.

	<p><b>Rescued Date:</b> November 15, 2020<br>
	<b>Given Name:</b>Kaypee<br>
	<b>Age:</b>4 weeks old<br>
	<b>Sex:</b> Female
	<br><br>
	This kitten was rescued last November 15 while we were walking with the Kapon 
    Pilipinas <br> team near my school, kittens often really cover the area because it is dark and full of <br> 
    garbage. He also had a fever last November 20 and ate well until yesterday night we <br> 
    noticed that he was always bent over and the gums were already swollen. <br><br> 
    <b>November 24, She passed away at exactly 5:49 pm.</b> Kaypee is just one of so many animals <br> that are thrown away every day. Sadly, the others are still small enough to live on the <br>
    streets.

	<b>Given Name:</b>Poco<br>
	<b>Age:</b>3-4 weeks old<br>
	<b>Sex:</b> Female
	<br><br>
	According to people in the market yesterday, we saw the kitten walking (no one really <br> noticed 
    such animals) Think of you as sick, without water and food and the weather is <br> very hot.Approx 3-4 weeks. Emaciated. Severely dehydrated. Crusty eyes and has a heavy <br> discharge on the 
    nose. The black cat is often thrown into the misconception of others <br> that it brings bad luck. <br><br>
    Poco was Spayed and Dewormed.
